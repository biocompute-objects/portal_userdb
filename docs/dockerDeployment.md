# BioCompute Portal Docker Deployment Instructions/notes [WIP]

To run an instance of the BioCompute Portal you will need to have three different services running:
1. BCO Portal UI
2. BCO User DB
3. At least once instance of the BCO DB

The first and second services are part of this repo and the BCODB is available at https://github.com/biocompute-objects/bco_api
