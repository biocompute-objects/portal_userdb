## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [Code of Conduct](docs/contributing/code_of_conduct.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [hadleysemail.com](mailto:email@example.com).

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/portal_userdb/blob/ContributionDoc/README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/portal_userdb/tree/ContributionDoc/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/portal_userdb/tree/ContributionDoc/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.
## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report
A good bug report shouldnâ€™t leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.
If you find a bug, please create an issue on GitHub with the following information:

- A clear and descriptive title.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Expected and actual behavior.
- Screenshots or logs, if applicable.
- Any other information that might be helpful.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Biocompute project, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/portal_userdb/blob/ContributionDoc/README.md) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/portal_userdb/tree/ContributionDoc/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.
